1. At first test LCD display. Testing LCDs helps identify any manufacturing defects or anomalies in the display, such as dead pixels, color irregularities, or backlight issues. Ensuring a defect-free display is critical for delivering a high-quality product.
2. Then find the I2C module address. I2C devices communicate over a shared bus, and each device is assigned a unique address. In complex systems with multiple I2C devices, it's essential to identify which devices are connected to the bus and their respective addresses. This information is crucial for proper initialization and communication with each device.
